<Note>Collaboration is available in the [Basic plan](https://heyform.net/pricing) and above.</Note>

HeyForm allows teams to work together by letting you invite your team members to shared workspaces. You can share your forms and results securely without exchanging private login credentials.

### How to invite team members

To add new members to your workspaces, navigate to your HeyForm dashboard and click on `Members`.

Click the `Send` button. The invited team members will receive an email with an invitation to join HeyForm.

### How to manage access permissions

On your HeyForm dashboard, click `Members` in the sidebar to view an overview of workspace members.

From this page, you can also remove members or transfer ownership.

<Note>Removing a member from a workspace will <strong>not</strong> delete forms by the member. Only workspace owner can delete members.</Note>
