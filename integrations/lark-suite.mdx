### 1. Add Custom Bot

1. To add a custom bot, you have to click on your existing Lark group or create a new Lark group and click on settings.
2. Once you click on the settings simply go to the "BOTs" tab and click on the "Add Bot" button.
3. Finally, click on "Custom Bot" Add button to finish the step process. Once you finish this, you will get a URL that has to be placed on the HeyForm Lark integration tool.
