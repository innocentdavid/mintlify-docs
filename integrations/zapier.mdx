Zapier is a web service that automatically links actions between different web apps and synchronizes their applications with each other so that they can execute the desired processes. This is done with so-called "Zaps". A Zap uses a trigger, i.e. a triggering event, in one app to trigger an action in another. The application is flexible and diverse, as is the range of integration options. By integrating Zapier with HeyForm, you can set up workflows for every response you get from the clients with other apps you use the most. In this way, you can save time, and focus more on business-oriented tasks.
