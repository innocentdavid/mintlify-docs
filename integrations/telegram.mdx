Telegram is a free messenger service developed by brothers Pavel and Nikolai Durov. Telegram offers a wide range of functions. Besides the obligatory messenger chat function, users can also send large amounts of data in the form of audio and video messages, make voice calls, create channels, and use bots. With HeyForm, you can integrate with Telegram to get notifications for each HeyForm completion.

Integrating with Telegram is a piece of cake, so just follow this 3 step process to enable posting messages using the Telegram Bot in just a few minutes:

### 1. Add @HeyForm_bot to your Telegram group

Create or select your existing Telegram group where you want to receive notifications on and click the **Add Members** button.

Now search for `@HeyForm_bot` and select the `@HeyForm_bot` tag. Now, click on float button on the bottom right-hand corner and click on "Add" to end the procedure.
