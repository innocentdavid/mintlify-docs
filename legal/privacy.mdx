Other data you intentionally share with us, we will store, ie we may collect your personal information or data if you submit it to us in other contexts.

## Privacy for Form respondents?

When you respond to forms hosted by HeyForm, we collect, on behalf and upon instructions, including the ones provided in this privacy policy, of form creators, information relating to you and your use of our services from a variety of sources. These are listed below. The sections afterward describe what HeyForm does with this information.

### Form responses

HeyForm collects and stores the form responses that you submit. The form creator is responsible for this data and manages it. A form may ask you to provide personal information or data. If you have any questions about a form you are taking, please contact the form creator directly as HeyForm is not responsible for the content of that form. The form creator is usually the same person that invited you to take the form and sometimes they have their own privacy policy. HeyForm will not check all form contents created by our users, ie form creator and if you see any issues due to the form contents, you have contacted them directly to remove the content. You will need to ask the form creator as it depends on how the individual, company, or organization has chosen to configure the form(s). HeyForm provides instructions describing how a form creator can ensure collected responses are done so anonymously. However, even if a form creator has followed those steps, specific questions in the form may still ask you for your personal information or data that could be used to identify you.

### Information collected from form respondents

Our form responses are owned and managed by the form creator. HeyForm treats that information as private to the form creator, except if the form creator has made the questions and responses available via a public link. Please contact the form creator directly to understand how the individual, company, or organization uses your form responses. Some form creators may provide you with a privacy policy or notice at the time you complete its form and we encourage you to review that to understand how the form creator will handle your responses. HeyForm does not sell or make available form responses to third parties without the form creator’s permission and HeyForm does not use any contact details collected in our customers’ forms to contact form respondents. HeyForm also uses the information collected from you, including usage data, device data, referral data, and information from page tags to manage and improve our services, for research purposes, and for the various purposes described in this privacy policy.

HeyForm does not sell or make available your form responses without express permission! HeyForm will share your form responses with third parties only as described in this privacy policy.

HeyForm hosts forms created by form creators. However, form creators are actually the primary curator of form data. Anything you expressly disclose in your form responses will, naturally, be provided to them. Please contact the form creator directly to understand how they might share your form responses. Please see this privacy policy to understand what HeyForm tells form creators about how HeyForm handles form responses, and to whom HeyForm may disclose form responses.

### Right of respondents information

Contact the form creator to access and correct your responses and personal information. Because HeyForm collects form responses on behalf of form creators, you will need to contact the form creator if you have any questions about the form, or if you want to access, update, or delete anything in your responses. HeyForm provides form creators with tools to maintain the responses they collect through their forms. You may request access to and correction of the personal information we hold about you by contacting customer support, however, in most cases HeyForm cannot provide you with this access since form responses are the form creator’s private information (except if the form creator has made the questions and responses available via a public link) and giving you access may have an unreasonable impact on the privacy of other individuals. HeyForm will respond to your request for access or correction within a reasonable time and, where reasonable and practicable to do so, HeyForm will provide access to your personal information in the manner requested by you.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

HeyForm reserves the right to review, alter, update, and/or remove portions of this Privacy Policy in the future. We may modify this Privacy Policy at any time, in our sole discretion and all modifications will be effective immediately upon our posting of the modifications on our website or notice board. Please check back from time to time to review our Privacy Policy. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective as of the last updated date provided above. By using our Website and/or the Services, you accept the version of this Privacy Policy in place at that time.
